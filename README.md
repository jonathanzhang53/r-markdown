# Jonathan Zhang's R-Markdown

Hello, I started learning R during my summer internship at St. Jude (June --- August 2019).

Here I will post stuff I have done in R as knitted `.html` files read from `.rmd` files using RStudio's rmarkdown package.

## Usage

If you want to see my stuff, just clone the repository and open up the html files in each folder.

```
  git clone https://github.com/jonathanzhang53/r-markdown.git
```
