# Seurat

Seurat is a comprehensive R package used to parse sc-rnaseq data. The documentation can be found [here](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).

My tasks included immunophenotyping the stromal microenvironment of healthy murine mammary glands with a supervised dataset.

Since I cannot post / share my data, there are functions in `functions.rmd` that I wrote along the way that helped me with analyzing data. I took advanatage of Seurat's integration of ggplot2 in order to visualize with tSNE and violin plots.
